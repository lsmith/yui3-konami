This YUI 3 module adds a new special event named 'konami'.  Based on the Konami code (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code), subscribers will be executed only once and should do something particularly awesome.  Think unicorns.

Typically, you'll want to subscribe to this event on the document, but it can be attached to any element that receives keydown events.

Y.on('konami', function (e) {
    
    MyApp._grantAllAccess(MyApp.getCurrentUser());

}, document);

or

Y.get('#scrollableArea').on('konami', function (e) {
    Y.later(3000, this, function (content) {
        this.setContent(content);
    }, this.get('innerHTML'));

    this.setContent("<strong>You're awesome!  Now get back to work.</strong>");
});
